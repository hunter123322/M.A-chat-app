project:
  name: "Real-Time Chat Application"
  type: "Web Application"
  description: >
    A full-featured real-time chat web application built using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and MySQL. 
    This project is developed as part of a project-based learning initiative, aiming to simulate production-grade systems 
    and focus on backend engineering.

purpose:
  goals:
